# Helix Deployment Cache Permission Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve the Node.js module cache permission issues during deployment.

## Problem Description

The deployment was failing with the following error:
```
Permission denied error when accessing .cache/replit/modules/nodejs-20 directory during deployment build process
Build process failing during layer creation phase preventing successful deployment
File system permissions issue blocking access to required Node.js runtime modules
```

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Environment Variables Added

The following environment variables have been configured to disable package caching:

- `NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=/tmp/.npm` - Redirects npm cache to temporary directory
- `DISABLE_NPM_CACHE=true` - Disables npm package caching
- `DISABLE_OPENCOLLECTIVE=true` - Disables OpenCollective funding messages
- `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096` - Increases Node.js memory limit
- `KEEP_DEV_DEPENDENCIES=true` - Keeps development dependencies during build
- `NPM_CONFIG_PROGRESS=false` - Disables npm progress indicators
- `NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL=warn` - Reduces npm logging verbosity
- `NPM_CONFIG_AUDIT=false` - Disables npm audit checks
- `NPM_CONFIG_FUND=false` - Disables npm funding messages
- `NPM_CONFIG_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=false` - Disables npm update notifications

### 2. NPM Configuration (.npmrc)

Created `.npmrc` file with comprehensive cache redirection:
```
cache=/tmp/.npm
fund=false
audit=false
update-notifier=false
disable-opencollective=true
progress=false
loglevel=warn
cache-min=0
```

### 3. Deployment Configuration Files Updated

#### Render.com (render.yaml)
- Added cache clearing commands in buildCommand
- Set proper environment variables
- Created npm cache directory with correct permissions

#### Vercel (vercel.json)
- Added environment variables in builds configuration
- Excluded cache directories from builds
- Added cache clearing in buildCommand

#### Railway (railway.json)
- Updated buildCommand with cache fixes
- Set proper environment variables
- Added cache clearing steps

#### Docker (Dockerfile)
- Added environment variables at container level
- Created npm cache directory with proper permissions
- Modified install and build commands to use --no-cache

### 4. Deployment Script (deploy.sh)

Created comprehensive deployment script that:
- Sets all required environment variables
- Clears existing cache directories
- Creates temporary npm cache with proper permissions  
- Builds application with cache disabled
- Starts application with production settings

## Usage Instructions

### For Local Testing
```bash
# Make script executable and run
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### For Render.com Deployment
1. The `render.yaml` file is automatically used
2. Environment variables are set in the configuration
3. Cache clearing happens during build process

### For Vercel Deployment
1. The `vercel.json` file configures the build
2. Environment variables are applied to builds
3. Cache directories are excluded

### For Railway Deployment
1. The `railway.json` file handles the configuration
2. Build commands include cache clearing
3. Environment variables are set for the deployment

### For Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build with cache fixes
docker build -t helix-regulatory-platform .

# Run with environment variables
docker run -p 5000:5000 helix-regulatory-platform
```

## Verification

After applying these fixes, the deployment should:
- ✅ Successfully access Node.js runtime modules
- ✅ Complete build process without permission errors
- ✅ Deploy to production environment
- ✅ Start application normally

### Verification Script

Run `./verify-deployment-fixes.sh` to confirm all fixes are properly applied:
```bash
chmod +x verify-deployment-fixes.sh
./verify-deployment-fixes.sh
```

### Deployment Testing

Test deployment with the comprehensive script:
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## Environment Variables Summary

All deployment platforms now include these variables:
```bash
NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=/tmp/.npm
DISABLE_NPM_CACHE=true
DISABLE_OPENCOLLECTIVE=true
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096
KEEP_DEV_DEPENDENCIES=true
NPM_CONFIG_PROGRESS=false
NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL=warn
NPM_CONFIG_AUDIT=false
NPM_CONFIG_FUND=false
NPM_CONFIG_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=false
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

## Next Steps

1. Test deployment with your chosen platform
2. Monitor build logs to confirm cache fixes are working
3. Verify application starts successfully
4. Check that all features work in production environment

If you continue to experience issues, the deployment script provides detailed logging to help identify any remaining problems.
