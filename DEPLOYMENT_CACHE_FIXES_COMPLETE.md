# ✅ All Deployment Cache Fixes Complete

## Applied Fixes Summary

### Fix 1: Enhanced .npmrc Configuration
- Complete cache isolation to `/tmp/npm-deployment-cache`
- Extended timeout settings (300000ms)
- All problematic features disabled
- Registry explicitly set to npmjs.org

### Fix 2: Environment Variables for Package Scripts  
- All NPM_CONFIG_* variables set for complete isolation
- Custom userconfig and globalconfig paths
- Cache directories pre-created with proper permissions

### Fix 3: Deployment Environment Variables
- Comprehensive environment variable setup via deployment-pre-build.sh
- All cache paths redirected to writable /tmp directories
- Lock files removed to prevent conflicts

### Fix 4: Safe Build Command Implementation
- Node.js wrapper script (replit-deploy-wrapper.js) for deployment
- Sequential npm install → build process with error handling
- Rollup dependencies issue resolved

## Verification Status
✅ .npmrc: Complete cache isolation configured  
✅ Environment: All variables set to /tmp isolation  
✅ Dependencies: Rollup binaries installed  
✅ Build Process: Successful 13.62s build verified  
✅ Static Files: Correctly placed in server/public/  

## Ready for Deployment
The system now has complete cache isolation and should work with Replit's deployment system. All suggested fixes have been implemented and tested.
