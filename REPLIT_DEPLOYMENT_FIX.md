# REPLIT DEPLOYMENT DATABASE FIX

## Problem Identified
- Development environment: 21 data sources ✅
- Production hosting: 0 data sources ❌
- Issue: DATABASE_URL not available in Replit hosting environment

## Solution Applied
1. Enhanced database connection logging
2. Added production environment detection
3. Fixed static file serving

## Current Status
- Local development: WORKING (21 sources, 5,454 updates)
- Production build: READY (dist/index.js created)
- Static files: COPIED (server/public/ populated)

## Deployment Instructions
1. Click Deploy button in Replit
2. Ensure DATABASE_URL is configured in deployment environment
3. Verify production deployment has database access

## Verification
- Development API: http://localhost:5000/api/data-sources ✅
- Production API: https://helixv1-delta.replit.app/api/data-sources ❌

The issue is DATABASE_URL environment variable access in production.
